Make size of screen a derivation of the atomic size of a square (leave a 2 px black border, and each square filled with orange temporarily)

Interface b/w game and minds messed up, cells should be returning actions
~~~Rules for the interface
	 Mind only gets to choose 1 action per turn
	      This could manifeest as returning an action, or the view could store the last action choosen (the mind would call a method of the action, if the method was called multiple times the  view would only remember the last call)
	      As has been said before, if youre doing the latter of theseaction's constructors can havee no side effects

Lets make it actually return an action: So whats this mean?

Action can be created when they're not valid, need to be light weight

*Eventually need to spawn Mind decide in other thread and monitor it, giving it a time limit. (Cuz you can't have players doing inifinite loops)

The View should probably still confirm the action, lets the game control a copy of each

Its still going to be possible to cheat because you can call those mthods on the view at this point, but its a step in the right direction

Really need to set up test cases

Really work on that thread monitoring thing. You can use that fo a sanity test for new bots, and even have one always sporadically checking the game just in case.

Map actions (action checkers) by their name
